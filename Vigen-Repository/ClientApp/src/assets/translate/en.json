        "CONTSUB1":"When a person shares her story of violence, she is taking the first step in breaking the cycle of abuse. We must ensure that she has the safe space she needs to speak and be heard. It is important to remember that when dealing with cases of sexual violence, the victim's sobriety, dress and sexuality are irrelevant. The perpetrator is solely responsible for the assault and must take responsibility alone. Protest against victim-blaming and challenge the idea that people should avoid situations that are perceived as ''dangerous'' by traditional standards. Survivors are speaking out more than ever, and we can all do something to ensure they get justice. Don't say, 'Why didn't you get out of there?' Say, 'We hear you. We believe you. We are with you.'",

        "CONTSUB2":"The example we set for the younger generation shapes the way they think about gender, respect and human rights. It initiates conversations about gender roles at an early age and challenges the traditional traits and characteristics assigned to men and women. Point out the stereotypes that girls and boys constantly face, whether in the media, on the street or at school, and let them know that there is nothing wrong with being different. Encourage a culture of acceptance.",

If you think someone is abusing you, help is available.",
        "SUB4":"4. Demonstrate your opposition to rape culture:",
        "CONTSUB4":"Rape culture occurs in social environments that allow sexual violence to be normalized and justified, and in these environments it is fueled by persistent gender inequalities and attitudes about gender and sexuality. Naming rape culture is the first step in banishing it. Every day we have the opportunity to examine our behaviors and beliefs for the biases that allow rape culture to continue to exist. Think about how you define masculinity and femininity, and how your own biases and stereotypes influence them. From our attitudes about gender identities to the policies we support in our communities, everyone can take action to fight rape culture.",

Speak out against certain behaviors by pointing them out: whistling, inappropriate sexual comments and sexist jokes are never acceptable. Promote a safer environment by challenging your colleagues to reflect on their own."
