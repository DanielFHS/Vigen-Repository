We must ensure that she has the safe space she needs to speak and be heard. It is important to remember that when dealing with cases of sexual violence, the victim's sobriety, dress and sexuality are irrelevant. The perpetrator is solely responsible for the assault and must take responsibility alone. Protest against victim-blaming and challenge the idea that people should avoid situations that are perceived as ''dangerous'' by traditional standards. Survivors are speaking out more than ever, and we can all do something to ensure they get justice. Don't say, 'Why didn't you get out of there?' Say, 'We hear you. We believe you. We are with you.'",

Naming rape culture is the first step in banishing it. Every day we have the opportunity to examine our behaviors and beliefs for the biases that allow rape culture to continue to exist.
